     * 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
     * https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
     * Output: 5
     * Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
     *              Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
     *
     * Example 2:
     * Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
     * Output: 0
     * Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
